# White Dwarf Star Simulation (Chandrasekhar Limit)

This is a simple Python simulation of a white dwarf star model using a 4th order Runge-Kutta solver.

## What it does
- Solves the equilibrium equations of white dwarfs
- Plots Solar Mass vs Solar Radius
- Explores the Chandrasekhar limit

## How to run
Requires Python 3.13 and via the CMD "pip install numpy matplotlib" then run "white_dwarf_simulation.py"
